 Turbulence Modelling K-Epsilon Modelling
 
 
 Method:
 1. The equations are discretized explicitly
 2. The k and epsilon equations have new stability condition
 3. The u and v equation's stability condition is also changed due to the dependence of k and epsilon
 
 Problem:
 1. The equation is highly instable and depends on both MESH and TIMESTEPS
 2. Only few settings can be used for simulation for a few timesteps
 3. The K values oscillate and produce negative K values which results in "nan" if the initial settings and timesteps are wrong.
